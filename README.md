## Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning


## TODOs
1. Dockerize everything
2. Create "train" endpoint
  a. Allow users (students) to send either an x or an o
  b. That data should be saved somewhere
  c. At some point (probably manual trigger), add new training data to existing training data and re-train
3. Try to refactor React code to be functional (update libraries, etc.)


Fit the input into a 10x10 matrix (requires bucketing )
Use MongoDB to store training data
